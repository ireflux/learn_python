When I was a child, Whenever things in life have two or more options, I don’t know how to choose. Or when things are difficult for me, I don't know how to do is right.

When I saw 20s people encounter problems, they could handled it very well. They seem to know everything. So I thought I can do this like them when I 20s. At that time, I will no need anyone to ask for help.

Now I'm 22. I fount I still can't make a choice right now for difficult things. I still don't know how to do is right. I am trying to find a perfect way to slove difficult question in the life, there may not be a 'perfect' way at all. I have also seen some 30s people ask some question or chat on forum, sometimes I can feel their negative emotions. Obviously, they can't solve all the problems either. There is a saying in the Chinese Analects：三十而立，四十而不惑，五十而知天命，六十而耳顺，七十而从心所欲，不逾矩。Can really no doubt at forty? I don't think so. This question may be when I 40 years old, then I will be know.

Every adult is a child, they can't slove everything problem. they are also need keep learning. Everyone is the same. The difference with children is that the older the more difficult to be forgiven if make a same mistake. The cost of mistakes will increase. Life does not allow them too many opportunities to try, so they can only be cautious, walking every step of the ice. They also have negative emotions, but they are not easily displayed in front of people.
