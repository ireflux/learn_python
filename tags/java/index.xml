      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;前言&#34;&gt;前言&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently,I was learning the Spring Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I learn it from Spring official website of the guide. When I completed the first few guides, I find that I didn’t even understand why. So I had to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I looked for other guides to learn and saw many examples of IOC(Inversion of Control), DI(Dependency Injection), and AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming). I probably understand, but I still can&amp;rsquo;t use the Spirng framework. on the forum, Someone told me that I only need more practice. But I don&amp;rsquo;t even know it how to work, e.g. annotation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
